### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this tip calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### What I learned

The project was a bit of recap of what i have been learnd the last few months with html, css and js. So the project i self was good for me to do. The main focus in this was the Javascript. I wanted to try and figure out every problem by my self from start do finish.
